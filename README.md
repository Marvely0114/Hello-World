- I really enjoyed coding in general; I was previously exposed to Arduino IDE coding and C++ but I enjoy more machine learning coding and ==maneuvering== through files and large quantities of data. Though I have not officially declared Bioinformatics major, I intent to pursue a master's in Bioinformatics and finishing the interdisciplinary Biotechnology bachelor's. ==I enjoyed everything about this class.==
